# How-We-Operate

This Living Document will change over time, start a convo with the community; whats you're your idea?

Just because it is written; doesn't make it so; raise an Issue, start a discussion, let us talk about it.

## Custodian Trust Responsibilities

- Ensure the group's actions do not taint the original project vision.

Any responsibilities below that require time, effort or resources; do not apply to the custodian trust; ethics do as that costs Zero calories.

So we do not place undue demands on those who secure the network;

## Lead Developer Responsibilities

- Merge all PR's that add functionality in line with the Founders vision.
- Remain actively contactable in some format to the Custodian Trust via non-internet methods.
- Not allow people to be nasty; I'm not spelling it out, don't do it, calm down; we all love the code too. 
- Act in good faith.
- This is not a paid role and never will be.
- Remember, country borders are lines imagined on a spinning ball in space.
- Think why? Why not? Who said so?

## Developer Responsibilities

- Actively find lousy code and make it hurt till it's gone.
- Talk about what you are doing in code comments.
- Remember to use clear English in naming choices and their adjacent code comments.
- We do not all speak English; simple wording is perfect. No novels are required.
- Never knowingly hurt the community.
- The answer "Get Fucked" to any request that harms users security, privacy, confidentiality, either past, present or future.
- As a developer of this Security R&D group, you must disclose ALL communications of governmental bodies to our GitHub repo; we will not talk in private.
- Always disclose security bugs to the author first, if possible. Or use the contact you believe to be the best on non-public channels.
- Our goal is to remove dev team control; how? We'll figure it out.
